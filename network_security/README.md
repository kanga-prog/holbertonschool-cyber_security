# Network Security

This repository contains projects related to computer network security as part of the Holberton School Cybersecurity curriculum.  
The goal of these projects is to provide a solid understanding of how networks operate, how information travels, and how vulnerabilities can be identified using both passive and active techniques.

## Contents

- **0x01 Passive Reconnaissance**  
  Learn how to gather information about targets without direct interaction. This includes DNS queries, WHOIS lookups, metadata extraction, and OSINT enumeration.

More modules will be added progressively as the program advances.

## Learning Objectives

Across the different projects, you will learn:

- Fundamentals of network protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, ICMP)
- Differences between passive and active reconnaissance
- How to analyze domain information (WHOIS, DNS records)
- How to enumerate a network using OSINT tools
- Basics of network scanning and security assessment

## Environment & Requirements

- System: **Kali Linux**
- Language: **Bash scripting**
- All scripts must:
  - Start with `#!/bin/bash`
  - Follow the **Betty** style guidelines
  - Be executable
  - Contain exactly the required number of lines per task
  - End with a newline
